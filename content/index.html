<h1>Documentation for the Bytemark BigV (bigv.io) API</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk" target="_blank">Bytemark's</a> new <a href="http://bigv.io" target="_blank">BigV</a>
service does not currently have any official documentation.</p>

<p>This will, at some point, be ported over to the bigv.io site and form the official documentation, but currently serves as a way of providing some notes to as an source of reference for the API.</p>

<p>If you have any information, additions or corrections, then please do let me know.</p>

<p>The source code for this site is available here: <a href="https://github.com/ichilton/bytemark-bigv-api-doc" target="_blank">https://github.com/ichilton/bytemark-bigv-api-doc</a> so feel free to raise an issue or even a pull request.
