<h1>Unofficial Documentation of the Bytemark BigV (bigv.io) API</h1>

<p>The API behind <a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk" target="_blank">Bytemark's</a> <a href="http://bigv.io" target="_blank">BigV</a>
service is currently not publically documented.</p>

<p>This site serves as a way of providing some notes to serve as an initial source of reference for the API. Bytemark have supplied some of this information, but some of this is based on looking at the <a href="http://www.bigv.io/download" target="_blank">BigV command line client</a> and it's log files.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Tom Molesworth for providing me with his notes which made a great starting point when I was putting this together.</p>
